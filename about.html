    <h2>About Jawi and Rumi</h2>
    <p class="justify">
      The Malay language has two writing systems in modern use: the
      romanised script Rumi and the Arabic script Jawi. Rumi is now by
      far the more common of the two, but Jawi continues to be used for
      various cultural, religious, and administrative purposes, and in
      parts of Malaysia and in Brunei the script is co-official with
      Rumi. Jawi was the dominant script for writing Malay from around
      the 14th century until the 20th century. Its rise coincided with
      the arrival of Islam, which explains why its use today is often in
      religious contexts, but the script is not inherently tied to Islam
      nor to the Arabic language, just as how Rumi is not inherently
      tied to any European traditions.

    <p class="justify">
      As with Arabic, Malay words written in Jawi are mostly spelled
      without letters for vowels, but this fact does not change how the
      words are pronounced. The absence of vowels sometimes results in
      ambiguity that is not present in Rumi. For instance, ترک is either
      <em>terka</em> "guess" or <em>trak</em> "truck", and the reader
      decides the pronunciation depending on context. Similarly, there
      may be a single Rumi spelling that has multiple Jawi spellings,
      such as <em>merah</em> which can be written مره or ميره; the
      difference here being that the second form uses ي ("ya") for the
      <em>e</em> vowel in <em>merah</em>.
