    <h2>About Jawi and Rumi</h2>
    <p class="justify">
      The Malay language has two writing systems in modern use: the
      romanised script Rumi and the Arabic script Jawi. Presently, Rumi
      is by far the more common of the two, but Jawi continues to be
      used for various cultural, religious, and administrative purposes,
      and in parts of Malaysia and in Brunei the script is co-official
      with Rumi. Jawi was the dominant script for writing Malay from
      around the 14<sup>th</sup> century until the 20<sup>th</sup>
      century. Prior to that, Old Malay scripts, Kawi and Rencong, were
      derived from Sanskrit. Letters in Jawi largely correspond to those
      in Arabic, with modifications made; in particular, the addition of
      extra letters to represent sounds absent in Arabic. The absence of
      vowels sometimes results in ambiguity that is not present in Rumi.
      For instance, ڤيلو is either <em>pilu</em> (sadness) or
      <em>pilau</em> (a native boat), and the reader decides the
      pronunciation depending on context. Similarly, there may be a
      single Rumi spelling that has multiple Jawi spellings, such as
      <em>merah</em> which can be written مره or ميره; the difference
      here being that the second form uses ي ("ya") for the <em>e</em>
      vowel in <em>merah</em>.

      Jawi’s rise coincided with the arrival of Islam, which explains
      why its use today is often in religious contexts. However, the
      script is not inherently tied to Islam nor to the Arabic language,
      just as how Rumi is not inherently tied to any European
      traditions. After its adoption, Jawi became the dominant writing
      system in maritime Southeast Asia; the script of choice for legal
      documents, communications between kings, trade agreements,
      treaties, tax records, religious tracts, non-fictional and
      creative writings. One genre of texts that used this script was
      Malay medical manuscripts, known variously as <em>Kitab Tib</em>,
      <em>Kitab Obat-Obatan</em> and <em>Kitab Mujarrabat</em>.
      Surviving manuscripts show that the script was used to write
      prescriptions that draw from multiple religious traditions. Islam
      was a primary influence in this medical system but words for
      charms and mantras for healing also alluded to deities or spirits
      from Hindu-Buddhist and indigenous-animist tradition. Jawi was
      thus used to articulate texts for multiple functions and expressed
      diverse religious ideas.

    <p class="justify">
      The romanisation of the Malay language was likely a consequence of
      European imperialism in the region. Antonio Pigafetta, an Italian
      explorer who accompanied Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in
      circumventing the globe, was one of the first to generate a list
      of Malay terms in Roman letters, providing their meanings in
      Italian in the early 16<sup>th</sup> centuries. More Romanised
      vocabulary lists emerged as the Portuguese and later, the Dutch
      and the British, intensified their colonial projects in the
      region. Unlike Jawi, which developed without an authoritative
      centre directing spelling and orthography, in the early twentieth
      century, British and Dutch colonial authorities standardised the
      Romanised spellings (Rumi) through the Wilkinson spelling system
      and the van Ophuijsen spelling system respectively. These systems
      were adopted as standard for communication within these colonies,
      pushing Jawi to the margins. The marginalisation of Jawi persisted
      after decolonisation, aided by the Western educated leaders in
      Malaysia and Indonesia for whom a Rumi system of writing was more
      advantageous than Jawi, which would have privileged an Islamic
      educated class.

      Although Malaysia’s 1957 Declaration of the Independence was
      written in Jawi, the writing system was not widely used in
      government administration. The status of Rumi was further elevated
      through the National Language Act in 1963 that formally instituted
      Rumi as the national writing system for the Malay language. Jawi
      retreated into religious schools and specialist language
      newspapers. In Indonesia, similar developments took place; the
      writing system virtually disappeared from official documents,
      textbooks and creative writing in the public sphere by 1956. Calls
      to re-establish the Jawi script as a national writing system or in
      school textbooks emerged periodically in Malaysia &ndash; the
      latest as recent as 2019 &ndash; where such pressure was usually
      linked to a political agenda for Malayisation of the nation. To
      date, however, the ability to read and write in Jawi is a skill
      that at least two generations of citizens in both states are not
      widely conversant with. This Jawi-Rumi converter reflects that
      need for a tool that could make these writings systems legible to
      all speakers of the Malay language and facilitate the reading of
      historical sources.
