    <h1>Technical Details of the Converter</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Algorithmic Details</h2>
      <p class="justify">The Rumi&ndash;Jawi converter is at its core a
      dictionary-based method, meaning that each Rumi or Jawi word is
      looked up in the dictionary and, if it exists, mapped to one or
      more forms in the other script. The results are concatenated
      together into the output box. This process has a few more steps
      that are detailed below.</p>
      <h3>Step 1: Tokenization</h3>
      <p class="justify">A computer does not know what a word is, so,
      from the perspective of the converter, the input box only contains
      a sequence of characters. <em>Tokenization</em> is the process of
      finding word boundaries (or token boundaries, more generally) in
      this character sequence. Unlike, say, Chinese or Japanese, Malay
      is written in both Rumi and Jawi with spaces between words and
      this makes the task considerably easier. There are still some
      challenges, however, such as punctuation. If words were only ever
      split at spaces, then it might act as though "<em>makan,</em>"
      (including the comma) is a word and fail to find an entry in the
      dictionary, whereas it would have found "<em>makan</em>" (without
      the comma).</p>
      <p class="justify">In the converter, sequences of letter
      characters (Latin or Arabic) are grouped into tokens that get
      converted while whitespace and most punctuation is ignored.
      Hyphens (-), however, are used frequently in both Rumi and Jawi
      for reduplication, and they are therefore included in word tokens.
      Commas, semicolons, and question marks appear differently in Rumi
      and Jawi and are therefore handled specially.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Normalization</h3>
      <p class="justify">Once words have been found by tokenization,
      they are passed to a conversion function depending on the
      direction of conversion (Rumi-to-Jawi or Jawi-to-Rumi), and the
      first step of conversion is normalization. This step reduces
      variation that would make conversion difficult.</p>
      <p>In Rumi-to-Jawi conversion, the only word normalization that is
      done is downcasing. Computers see <em>A</em> and <em>a</em>
      as different letters, so if the dictionary contained a word like
      <em>kuning</em> in the dictionary, it would not find
      <em>Kuning</em>.</p>
      <p class="justify">In Jawi-to-Rumi conversion there is no
      downcasing as Jawi does not have upper and lower case, but there
      are other reasons for variation. In Jawi, the preferred letter for
      /k/ sounds is ک rather than the Arabic kaf ك, but some documents
      nevertheless use the latter, so these are normalized to the
      former. Similarly, Jawi uses ݢ for the /g/ sound, but sometimes
      people use گ or ڬ instead, so these latter two get normalized to
      the first one.</p>
      <p class="justify">For conversion in both directions, commas,
      semicolons, and question marks are replaced with the appropriate
      version.</p>

      <h3>Step 3: Morphological Analysis</h3>
      <p class="justify">Malay has a robust morphological system of
      prefixes and suffixes which, for instance, change the root
      <em>ajar</em> ("teach"/"learn") to <em>pelajar</em> ("student"),
      <em>ajaran</em> ("precept"/"lesson"), <em>pelajaran</em>
      ("education"), <em>belajar</em> ("to learn"), <em>mengajar</em>
      ("to teach"), etc. Each of these words needs to be in the
      dictionary to be converted, but the system could be more robust if
      it could detect these affixes and convert them separately, because
      then it would only need to contain the roots and the affixes.</p>
      <p>The converter does not yet do this level of sophisticated
      morphological analysis, but if it fails to find a word in the
      dictionary, the word ends in <em>lah</em>/له (a common discourse
      suffix), and the word without the suffix exists in the dictionary,
      then the word and the suffix are converted separately. For
      Jawi-to-Rumi conversion, words beginning with د (<em>di</em>) are
      similarly converted separately when the whole word is not in the
      dictionary. This is because the adposition <em>di</em> ("in"/"at")
      sometimes appears attached to words in Jawi where it would be a
      separate word in Rumi.</p>

      <h3>Step 4: Dictionary Lookup</h3>
      <p class="justify">Once all the tokenization, normalization, and
      morphological analysis is complete, the actual dictionary lookup
      step is trivial: if the word is in the dictionary, the mapped form
      is used; if not, the original word is retained.</p>

      <h1>Display Details</h1>
      <p class="justify">Aside from the algorithmic details of
      conversion, there are some additional technicalities in the way
      the results are presented.</p>

      <h3>Font</h3>
      <p class="justify">Jawi is an Arabic script but it uses characters
      not present in the Arabic language, so it is important to choose a
      font containing glyphs for these characters. This site uses
      Google's <a
      href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/#naskh-arab">Noto Naskh
      Arabic</a> font as it contains these glyphs and is a neutral
      typeface without many embellishments.</p>

      <h3>Writing direction</h3>
      <p class="justify">As Arabic scripts like Jawi are written from
      right to left and Latin scripts like Rumi are written from left to
      right, the input and output boxes of the converter are specified
      with these directionalities so the text displays appropriately.
      When the "Switch Direction" button is clicked, these
      directionalities are reversed.</p>

      <h3>Alternatives</h3>
      <p class="justify">Sometimes a word, whether in Rumi or Jawi, has
      multiple candidates for conversion. For instance, <em>dan</em>
      ("and") can be written both as دن and دان in Jawi, and سمبيلن can
      be either <em>sembilan</em> ("nine") or <em>sambilan</em>
      ("casual"). The converter tries to assist users in selecting the
      correct form by highlighting ambiguous conversions in blue.
      Clicking on the blue words shows the list of conversions at the
      top of the output box, as well as the original form. The user may
      then select the preferred conversion which will be used in the
      output. <strong>Be careful</strong> as any change to the content
      of the input box, such as typing a character or switching the
      direction of conversion, will wipe out any selections, so only
      make such selections when the input will no longer change.</p>
