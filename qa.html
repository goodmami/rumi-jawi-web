    <h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
    <article>
      <h3><a href="#conversion" name="conversion">What is meant by
      "conversion"? Is it translation, transliteration, or
      transcription?</a></h3>
      <p>This question could have multiple answers as all three terms
      could be applicable. <em>Translation</em>, however, is not very
      precise as it is the script and not the language that is
      converted&mdash;the words are Malay whether they are represented
      in Rumi or Jawi. <em>Transliteration</em>, the substitution of
      letters, is better, but the purpose of conversion is to
      represent the sounds of Malay and not the writing system, so
      <em>transcription</em> is the most precise term. As an example,
      the Jawi word ڤلاجر translates to English as <em>student</em>
      and transcribes to Rumi as <em>pelajar</em>, but might be
      transliterated as <em>plajr</em> as the Jawi does not encode any
      vowel between the <em>p</em> and <em>l</em> sounds nor the
      <em>j</em> and <em>r</em> sounds.</p>

      <h3><a href="#how" name="how">How does the converter
      work?</a></h3>
      <p>The converter essentially performs dictionary lookup: for
      each word, we consult a mapping of Rumi and Jawi forms and, if
      the word exists in the mapping, we return the form it maps to.
      This method makes it quick to find good conversions and easy to
      improve by correcting mistakes in or adding new words to the
      dictionary, but has the drawback that it cannot convert any
      words it does not already have in the dictionary. Please refer
      to <a href="details.html">Technical Details</a> for more
      information.</p>

      <h3><a href="#why" name="why">Why does it not convert some
      words?</a></h3>
      <p>The converter can only convert words it already has in its
      dictionary. See <a href="#how">How does the converter work?</a>
      above for more information.</p>

    <article>
      <h3><a href="#why2" name="why2">Why does it not capitalize some
      names in Rumi?</a></h3>
      <p>All Rumi forms come from a
      <a href="https://github.com/goodmami/rumi-jawi/">dictionary</a>
      which only contains the Rumi and Jawi forms and not information
      such as part-of-speech or whether something is a name. If the
      Jawi and Rumi are unambiguously a name and it is not capitalized
      in Rumi, this is most likely an error that should be fixed.</p>
